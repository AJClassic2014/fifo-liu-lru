Discussion:
Compared with the FIFO and LRU, the LRU should be better. Because LRU creates less page fault than other two algrithms.FIFO is simple to be implemented the replacement algrithm but is not very effective. Because FIFO can get more page fault than other algrithms. LRU is difficult to implement but it will spend less time to replace the page.
